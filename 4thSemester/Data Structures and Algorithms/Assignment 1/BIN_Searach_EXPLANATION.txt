This code implements binary search algorithm in C++. The binary search algorithm is used to search for a specific element in a sorted array.

The code first initializes an integer array num_ar of size 10, containing sorted values between 0-30. It then prompts the user to enter a number to be searched. The function bin_search is then called with parameters:

arr: The integer array to be searched.
key: The element to be searched for.
l: The starting index of the subarray being searched.
n: The ending index of the subarray being searched.
c: A reference to an integer that keeps track of the number of iterations performed.
The bin_search function returns the index of the element if found, and -1 if not found. It first calculates the midpoint of the subarray being searched and compares it with the key value. If key is less than the midpoint, the function is recursively called with a new end index of m-1. If key is greater than the midpoint, the function is recursively called with a new start index of m+1. The function continues to divide the subarray in half until the key value is found or it is determined that it does not exist.

Finally, the main function prints the index of the element if found, or a message indicating that it was not found. It also prints the number of iterations performed during the search.
